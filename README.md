# Python Blog Posts

This repository contains code referenced in python-specific articles on by my blog at [martincarstenbach.com](https://martincarstenbach.com/).

I am trying my best to keep the examples current, but since I'm mainining the repository in my spare time, cannot guarantee everything is current all the time. Please pay particular attention to any `requirements.txt` files as they tend to be the first to be out of date.

The following code samples have been created:

| Project | Description | More info |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Flask Demo | A small sample application based on Flask 3.1, packaged in a container to connect to Oracle Database 23ai Free instance. | [Readme File](flask-oracle/readme.md) |
